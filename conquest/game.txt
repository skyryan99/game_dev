    Battle Cry:
        Cooldown 5 turns
        Cost 75
            A target troop you control gains +200 damage and
            +200 health until the start of your next turn. One
            of the most common commands chosen, it is often
            paired with Charge.
    Bombard:
        Cooldown 2 turns
        Cost 200
            A target enemy troop's health is reduced by 100.
            Troops defeated do not grant Command points.
    Charge:
        Cooldown 5 turns
        Cost 75
         	A target troop you control has its movement attribute
         	doubled for this turn. Often paired with Battle Cry,
         	or to give a Scout the range to quickly take out an
         	Archer or Mage.
    Chastise:
        Cooldown 3 turns
        Cost 50
         	A target enemy troop cannot move or attack during
         	your opponent's next turn. Cannot be used on an
         	opponent's last remaining troop. Chastise does not
         	prevent units from auto-retaliating if attacked
         	during your own turn. It is a common choice for a
         	command, useful for preventing the enemy from
         	targeting a vulnerable unit, or holding a buffed
         	enemy unit in place until the effect wears off.
    Regenerate:
        Cooldown 4 turns
        Cost 150
            A target troop you control has its health completely
            restored. While an expensive choice, it can be useful
            for Champion-heavy strategies.
    Shield Wall:
        Cooldown 5 turns
        Cost 50
            All damage dealt to target troop you control is
            reduced to 100 until the start of your next turn.
    Stoicism:
        Cooldown 5 turns
        Cost 75
            A target troop you control gains +400 health
            until the start of your next turn.
    Vigilance:
        Cooldown 3 turns
        Cost 50
            A target troop you control strikes first when
            defending until the start of your next turn.
    Winds of Fate:
        Cooldown 2 turns
        Cost 150
            A command, at random, reaches the end of its
            cool-down period and is ready to use.

TODO:
- Perhaps put constraints on the adjacency of obstacles, so they never appear side by side
- Perhaps make random generations symmetrical
